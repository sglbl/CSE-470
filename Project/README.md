### Sparkle Lightweight Symmetric Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Project
- Implementation of Sparkle lightweight symmetric cryptographic algorithm with different functionalities and different modes (ECB, CBC, OFB and CBC)
- Implementation also contains tools in order to understand that any document (.doc/.docx, .pdf, ppt, xls etc.) has not been modified and determined by the creator, it takes the extract and encrypt it with a key that only the person who made the transaction reaches and appends it to the end of the file.
- To check that the overall file has not changed, it also performs the comparative verification tool with the hash value produced by performing the operations.
